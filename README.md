# StudentLink
An alternate styling of the Boston University Student Link User Interface. 

• The current BU Student Link UI has not seen any rigorous aesthetic update in quite some time (perhaps since it was created).
• Current UI for reference: https://www.bu.edu/studentlink
• This project is my personal redesign of the application's UI. It is primarily an aesthetic overhaul; users can select and navigate between the main content pages to see how an alternate styling would be applied to the current Student Link's surface-level navigation. 
• As I am not a BU administrator, this site does not collect any user data nor does it implement the server-side functionality of the actual Student Link.

DISCLAIMER: 
• This project is by no means affiliated with Boston University nor was it created on their request.
• This project is purely for my enjoyment and a show of my web design capabilities.
• The implemented BU logo is protected under Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.
