# StudentLink
An alternate styling of the Boston University Student Link User Interface. 

• The current BU Student Link UI has not seen any rigorous aesthetic update in quite some time (perhaps since it was created).

• Current UI for reference: https://www.bu.edu/studentlink

• This project is my personal redesign of the application's UI. It is primarily an aesthetic overhaul; users can select and navigate between the main content pages to see how an alternate styling would be applied to the current Student Link's surface-level navigation. 

• This site does not collect any user data nor does it implement the server-side functionality of the actual Student Link.

DISTINCTIVE COMPONENTS 🛠

• New color scheme, content organization, and improved interactivity.

• Dynamic changes when hovering over the Menu options on the homepage.

• Expanding/contracting directory list on the Index page when clicking on/off items.

• Mobile-optimized! While primarily geared toward use on desktops & laptops, feel free to pull it up on your phone –– I made some mobile-specific design choices / functionalities...  📲

• No templates used, just my own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  🧑‍💻

DISCLAIMER❗️ 

• This project is not a product of Boston University nor was it created on their request.

• This project is purely for my enjoyment and a show of my web design capabilities.

• The implemented BU logo is protected under Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.
